# Easy Minecraft Server Hosting
## In your PC

This repository contains pre-configured batch scripts (`start.bat`) for various Minecraft server versions. Each script automatically downloads the necessary files, including the PaperMC server, plugins like ViaVersion and ViaBackwards, and server properties. All you need to do is download the `start.bat` file for the Minecraft version you want, run it, and the server will be set up automatically.

## How to Use
1. Download the `start.bat` file for the Minecraft version you want to run.
2. Place the `start.bat` file in an empty folder.
3. Double-click the `start.bat` file to run it.
4. The script will automatically download the necessary server files and plugins.
5. Once everything is downloaded, your server will start.

## Plugins Included
- **ViaVersion**: Allows players from newer Minecraft versions to connect to your server.
- **ViaBackwards**: Allows players from older Minecraft versions to connect to your server.

## Notes
- Ensure that you have [Java SE 22](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk22-archive-downloads.html) or higher installed on your machine.
- The default server port is `25565`. Make sure this port is open on your network for others to connect. Or you can use playit to make the server public.
